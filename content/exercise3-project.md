## Exercise 3: Project Your Data

*1*{: .circle .circle-blue} Open the **Vancouver_UTM_z10** MXD from the **MXD** folder of the **gisData** folder you downloaded before the workshop.

Reset the data source if necessary.

WGS1984, a geographic coordinate system

We want to project this data into a projected coordinate system using a projection that is more appropriate for this area.

The standard projection used by the City of Vancouver is called **Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 10**.

The UTM projection divides the earth into 60 zones as a system for assigning coordinates to locations on the surface of the earth.

Sixteen zones, from 7 to 22, cover Canada, and Vancouver falls in Zone 10.

You can read more about the [UTM Grid](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geography/topographic-information/maps/utm-grid-map-projections/utm-grid-universal-transverse-mercator-projection/9779).
