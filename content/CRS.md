## Coordinate Reference Systems

Now I'm going to complicate things a bit by introducing the term **coordinate reference system (CRS),** of which projections are a part.

Simply put, a **CRS** is a way to reference a location in the world. 

- geospatial datasets use CRS to characterize the locations and shapes of things at or near the surface of the earth

What are some ways you can think of that we define location?

Latitude and longitude are a common way to define location. 
But these are angular measures, not measures of distance.
In order to understand distances between places on the surface of the earth and to be able to display on a map something that represents a proportional scale, direction, and shape relative to the things and relationships being represented



defines the translation between a location on the round earth and that same location, on a flattened, 2 dimensional coordinate system.
