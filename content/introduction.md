## Introduction

This introductory video will set the stage for what this workshop is all about.

[Why all world maps are wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIID5FDi2JQ)

### Key Points From the Video

* The surface of a sphere cannot be represented as a plane without distortion.
* A projection is the process by which we translate (or project) the spherical globe onto a flat surface.
* The object onto which maps are projected (i.e. cylinder, cone, or plane) affects the way the map appears.
* All map projections maintain certain properties while distorting others.
* Map projections can be useful, but they can also be misleading.

### Who remembers which projection Google Maps uses and why?

### What are the four properties that are either preserved or distorted depending on the projection?
