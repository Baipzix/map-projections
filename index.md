# Understanding Spatial Data: Map Projections

## Learning Outcomes

This workshop is intended to familiarize participants with foundational knowledge for working with spatial data. By the end of the workshop participants will be able to:

- describe what a coordinate reference system is
- describe what a map projection is
- understand what a transformation is
- know how to find the coordinate reference system of your data
- find additional resources

## Requirements and Setup

The exercises in this workshop will use Esri's ArcGIS Desktop software, available for download from [UBC IT](http://gis.ubc.ca/software/).

Students are able to download ArcGIS Desktop for $30 a year.

If you don't want to pay to use the software, you can [sign up for a free trial](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/trial?rmedium=esri_com_redirects01&rsource=https://links.esri.com/pro/trial), although there may be a pause on free trials during the pandemic unless your work is related to COVID-19.

If neither of these are an option for you and you are attending this workshop from home, you can still follow along and apply the principles learned in this workshop to the GIS software of your choice.

When workshops are again conducted on campus, there is a GIS lab available at the Research Commons with ArcGIS Desktop installed on computers there that can be used for a workshop.

There will be three applications that come with your download of ArcGIS Desktop.

- **ArcCatalog**: "file browser for managing and organizing your data"
- **ArcMap**: "program to view, edit, and analyze data and create maps"
- **ArcGIS Pro**: "newer program that has similar functionality to ArcMap but more 3D capability and better communication with ArcGIS Online"

For the purposes of this workshop, we will only be using **ArcMap**.

You will also need to download data and 3 MXD (maps).

Download the data and extract the compressed files into your **Downloads** folder.
