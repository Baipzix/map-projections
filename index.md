# Understanding Spatial Data: Map Projections

## Goals

This workshop is intended to familiarize participants with foundational knowledge for working with spatial data. By the end of the workshop participants will be able to:

- describe what a coordinate reference system is
- describe what a map projection is
- understand what a transformation is
- know how to define a projection in GIS
- find additional resources

## Requirements

The exercises in this workshop will use Esri's ArcGIS Desktop software, available for download from [UBC IT](http://gis.ubc.ca/software/).

If you don't want to pay to use the software, you can [sign up for a free trial](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/trial?rmedium=esri_com_redirects01&rsource=https://links.esri.com/pro/trial), although there may be a pause on free trials during the pandemic unless your work is related to COVID-19.

If neither of these are an option for you, you can still follow along and apply the principles learned in this workshop to the GIS software of your choice.
