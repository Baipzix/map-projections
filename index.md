# Foundations for Spatial Analysis: Understanding Map Projections

## Goals

This workshop is intended to familiarize participants with foundational knowledge for working with spatial data. By the end of the workshop participants will be able to:

- describe what a coordinate reference system is
- describe what a map projection is
- understand what a transformation is
- know how to define a projection in GIS
- find additional resources

## Requirements

The exercises in this workshop will use Esri's ArcGIS Desktop software, available for download from [UBC IT](http://gis.ubc.ca/software/).

If you don't want to pay to use the software, you can [sign up for a free trial](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/trial?rmedium=esri_com_redirects01&rsource=https://links.esri.com/pro/trial), although there may be a pause on free trials during the pandemic unless your work is related to COVID-19.

If neither of these are an option for you, you can still follow along and apply the principles learned in this workshop to the GIS software of your choice.

## Introduction

This introductory video will set the stage for what this workshop is all about.

## Key Points

* The surface of a sphere cannot be represented as a plane without distortion.`
*2*{: .circle .circle-red} `A projection is the process by which we translate (or project) the spherical globe onto a flat surface.`
* *3*{: .circle .circle-yellow} `The object onto which maps are projected (i.e. cylinder, cone, or plane) affects the way the map appears.`
* *4*{: .circle .circle-green} `All map projections come with tradeoffs in terms of shape, distance, size, etc.`
* *5*{: .circle .circle-purple} `Map projections can be useful, but they can also be misleading.`
